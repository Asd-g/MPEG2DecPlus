DGFix 1.0.0
-----------

by Donald Graft

DGFix is a command line program that corrects illegal D2V files.
Due either to bugs in software or to malformed streams, it is
possible to encounter D2V files that have illegal flag
sequences, such that a request is made for two consecutive
top or bottom fields. Top and bottom fields must strictly
alternate! When such an illegal transition occurs, the
Avisynth mpeg2source() filter (and other decoders that read
the D2V file) will generate field inverted video from the point
of error (and until a subsequent illegal transition cancels
the first one!). When you view the clip, the field order appears
to change at the illegal transition.

Standalone and some software players are able to ignore/correct
the illegal requests on the fly, but currently DGMPGDec
cannot. Therefore, this program can be used to fix the D2V file
before it is sourced into mpeg2source().

This program works with DGMPGDec version 1.0.0.

Usage: To use the program, type:

dgfix file.d2v

The program will create a fixed D2V file called file.d2v.fixed.
The program will report the errors and corrections to the
command window.
