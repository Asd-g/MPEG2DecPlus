Here's what I think is happening...

The skew amount is calculated from the first video frame which has a PTS attached.  But in most of the MPEG sequences I'm studying, many frames do not have an attached PTS (in fact, it seems that VOBs only have PTS attached to I-frames).  So what happens if the MPEG contains valid frames without PTS which appear prior to the first frame with PTS (in display order)?  They don't get counted in the skew calculation.

My plan originally was to derive the missing PTS for all frames, using the reciprocal of the frame rate and/or interpolation.  I haven't actually done it yet, but I believe that will fix the incorrect skews.
