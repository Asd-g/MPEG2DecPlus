DGVfapi 1.1.0
Frameserving with the New Decoding Functionality
------------------------------------------------

VFAPI frameserving is now supported. It uses the
DGDecode.dll, so both DGVfapi.vfp and DGDecode.dll
must be placed in the same directory as DGIndex.exe.
Do not rename these files.

I've noticed that sometimes you have to hit Convert twice in
the VFAPI Converter. This appears to be a VFAPI Converter
problem.

The procedure is as follows:

1. Place the files as described above.
2. Run DGIndex and verify that when you pull down
   the Help menu the VFAPI Plugin item is checked.
   You don't have to check it; it is checked automatically
   if the files are placed in the right place. Generate your
   D2V project file as usual.
3. Ensure that the VFAPI reader codec is installed.
4. Run the VFAPI Converter, select the D2V
   file, and hit OK.
5. Hit Convert and if the "fake" AVI file is not created,
   hit Convert again.

DVD2AVI's clipping feature is not supported.
