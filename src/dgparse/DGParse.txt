DGParse 1.2.1
by Donald Graft
---------------

This command line executable parses a D2V and displays useful
information to the standard output. It works with D2V files
generated by DGIndex 1.2.0. It shows the following information:

Clip field dominance
GOP starts
Encoded frame to display frame mappings
3:2 pattern sections
Illegal transitions (field dominance changes)
TFF/RFF flag values

Usage: dgparse d2v_file

The output is obvious except for the encoded frame-to-display frame
mappings. It works like this:

f: a,b,c

f is the encoded frame number (before any pulldown). a, b, and c are
the display frame numbers (after pulldown) in which the fields of the
encoded frame will appear.
